/Users/joaoabbott-gribben/Projects/clmystery/step2:Take a look inside your 'clues.txt'. What does the third clue tell you? Within the 'mystery' directory, which files should you look at, based on this clue?
/Users/joaoabbott-gribben/Projects/clmystery/step1-git:To push (upload) your 'clues.txt' file to Github, first "add" the file using `git add`.

/Users/joaoabbott-gribben/Projects/clmystery/step7:Now you're down to 4 suspects. First, destroy all the files you've created except for 'clues.txt' and 'suspects.txt', you don't need them anymore.
/Users/joaoabbott-gribben/Projects/clmystery/step8:The final outstanding clue is the list of memberships in the wallet found at the crime scene. All that's required now is to verify your suspect holds all of the relevant memberships.
/Users/joaoabbott-gribben/Projects/clmystery/step6:Now you have more information to identify the perpetrator. Peek into the './mystery/vehicles' file. What information does it contain? Cross-reference it with your 'clues.txt' again - is there anything else you could search for in the vehicles record?
/Users/joaoabbott-gribben/Projects/clmystery/step1:Now it's time to collect the clues! The officers on the scene are pretty meticulous, so they've written down EVERYTHING in their officer reports. Take a look at the 'mystery/crimescene' file. It's quite large so use the `less` command to view the contents of the file, one screen at a time.
/Users/joaoabbott-gribben/Projects/clmystery/step1:Once you've found all the clues it's time to save them to a separate file for future reference.
/Users/joaoabbott-gribben/Projects/clmystery/step1:Use `touch` to create a file named 'clues.txt'. Use `>` to save the output of the `grep` command to the 'clues.txt' file.
