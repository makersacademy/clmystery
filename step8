The last clue that you have left is the list of memberships in the wallet found at the crimescene. All you need to do now is to see if one of the suspects has all these memberships.

What files does the 'mystery/memberships' subdirectory contain? What is inside these files?

How many membership cards were in the wallet? Can you automatically count if the suspect has all of them using `grep`, `wc` and the pipe operator?
