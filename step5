 You're concerned that the investigation has been compromised. You use an old detective trick to cover your tracks.
 You found two witness interview files. Take a look inside both of them and save any useful information into a new file called 'interview_info.txt'.
  
 To recover your 'step5' file, use the `git checkout` command to check out the 'step-5' branch, and try to view this file again.
 You feel satisfied that you have covered your tracks - time to consolidate your files. Commit the file but DON'T PUSH IT YET!
 
 First checkout back into the 'master' branch, and merge the 'step-5' branch into 'master'.
