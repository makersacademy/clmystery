Ms. Church interviewed at 2:04pm. Says she didn't recognise the shooter and ran as soon as she heard the shots. She did see the car that fled the scene - a blue Honda with a license plate that starts with L337 and ends with 9. 
Ms. Sun has brown hair and is not from New Zealand. Not the witness from the cafe.
