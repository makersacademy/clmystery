Ms. Sun isn't from New Zealand. She also has brown hair- hence she can't be the witness from the cafe.
Ms Church says she didn't recognize the shooter and that she ran away as soon as the shots were fired.
Ms. Church saw the car that fled the scene - a blue Honda with license plate that starts with L337 and ends with 9.
