Both he and Jacqui appear 4 times in these files, and both he and Jacqui have all the cards of the suspect, but he is male as was said... dunno why Step 7 or whatever said I should have 4 suspects at that point, unless it was ignoring male criteria, and then I'm supposed to bring that in now? Or between then and now?
