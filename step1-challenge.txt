i can view a file without changing the actual directory using the file's path with absolute or relative path. ex: pwd => /users/tamasmagyarhunor/projects/command-line-practice/clmystery . and I wish to open my useless hello.txt file on my desktop. so i use cat /Users/tamasmagyarhunor/desktop/hello.txt (absolute path or i use cat ../../../desktop/hello.txt ! absolute path looks always the same because it starts from the root directory and relative path is relative because its path it's related on the actual directory so i have to find the path's relative way to the file i want to open without changing directory! oh well!! job done
